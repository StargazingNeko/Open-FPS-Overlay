# Project discontinued due to Nvidia, AMD, and Steam all providing options for FPS display now.



# Open-FPS-Overlay
## TO-DO:
1. Add functionality to the "Bind Key" button to listen for the key that is to be used to enable the overlay drawing and dll injection
2. Setup configuration file to store the key bindings and possible other future settings
3. Game/Process hooking and dll injection
4. DX/OpenGL overlay drawing
5. Possibly hash verification of some kind so that you can't simply replace the dll with a cheat or some other malicous code
6. Most likely more but I'm still studying on the needs for this
